    <h1>Basic HTML Animals</h1>
    <p>This is the first paragraph in our page. It introduces our animals.</p>

    <h2>The Llama</h2>
    <p>Our Llama is a big fan of list items. When she spies a patch of them on a web page, she will eat them like sweets, licking her lips as she goes.</p>

    <h2>The Anaconda</h2>
    <p>The crafty anaconda likes to slither around the page, travelling rapidly by way of anchors to sneak up on his prey.</p>

    <h1>Looking at lists</h1>

        <li>Asparagus</li>

    <p>Turn the following directions into an ordered list.</p>

        <li>When prompted, say the magic word</li>

        <li>Turn the handle and push</li>
    </ol>
